As my final project, I'll create a module on the DSP platform that allows for direct message sending and receiving, then use Tkinter to integrate it into a graphical user interface. There are multiple sections to the project.

I plan to expand the current ds_protocol module in Part 1 to enable commands and responses for direct messaging. This entails putting commands into action for sending messages, getting all and unread messages, and managing the replies to these actions. In order to confirm that these messages are being processed correctly, I will also need to build a test application (test_ds_message_protocol.py).

Developing a ds_messenger.py module that implements classes for message transmission and retrieval is part of part two. A DirectMessage class to represent messages and a DirectMessenger class with methods for sending, receiving, and retrieving all messages should be included in this module.
